# Architecture

AgentTrace is a thin, opinionated evidence layer. It does not run agents — it
records what they did and makes that record verifiable.

## Data model

`owners → agents → runs → events`, with `policies`, `approvals`, `artifacts`,
`attestations`, and `risk_flags` attached to runs (and optionally events).

See `prisma/schema.prisma`. Key constraints:

- `events(runId, seqNo)` unique — sequence numbers are unique within a run.
- `runs(agentId, runExternalId)` unique — idempotent external run ids.
- `policies(ownerId, name, version)` unique.

## Lifecycle

1. **Register** an owner and agent; optionally create a policy.
2. **Start** a run (`RUNNING`).
3. **Append** ordered events. Each must be the next sequence number; appends to
   a non-`RUNNING` run are rejected.
4. **Record** approvals (optionally bound to a specific event), artifacts, and
   attestations.
5. **Finalize** the run. This is a single transaction that:
   - verifies sequence continuity,
   - runs the deterministic risk engine,
   - persists risk flags and the rolled-up risk level,
   - builds the canonical receipt, chains event hashes, signs the run hash,
   - stores `receiptHash` + `receiptSignature` and flips status to `FINALIZED`.

After finalization the event log is frozen and the receipt is retrievable and
independently verifiable.

## Why tsx in production

The workspace consumes `@agenttrace/shared` as TypeScript source (its package
`main` points at `src`). To keep dev and prod module resolution identical, the
API process runs under `tsx` in both. The dashboard, by contrast, is bundled by
Next.js (with a webpack `extensionAlias` mapping `.js` → `.ts`).
